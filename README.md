# EXIF_remover

Removes exif from images. It overwrites the images, therefore be careful with sensible data!!!

Usage:

`python remove_exif --dir <your_image_directory>`

Dependencies are light (just numpy and Pillow)

Works for file types `.jpg`, `.gif`, `.png` and `.tga`, but can be easily adjusted.
